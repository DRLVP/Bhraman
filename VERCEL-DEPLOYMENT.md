# Vercel Deployment Guide for Budh Bhraman

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the Budh Bhraman application to Vercel, with a focus on troubleshooting common issues.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect your repository to Vercel**
   - Log in to your Vercel account
   - Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Configure project settings

2. **Configure environment variables**
   - Add all required environment variables from `.env.production`
   - Ensure you're using production API keys for all services

3. **Configure build settings**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
   - Node.js Version: 18.x (or later)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Monitor the build logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Syntax Errors

If you encounter syntax errors during build, such as:

```
Error: Expected a semicolon
```

Possible causes and solutions:

1. **Line ending issues**
   - Ensure consistent line endings (LF vs CRLF) across your codebase
   - Add a `.gitattributes` file with `* text=auto eol=lf` to normalize line endings

2. **Hidden characters**
   - Check for invisible characters or BOM markers in your files
   - Use a code editor that can show invisible characters

3. **Inconsistent syntax**
   - Verify that all code follows consistent syntax patterns
   - Run a linter like ESLint to catch syntax issues before deployment

### Environment Variable Issues

If your application fails due to missing environment variables:

1. **Check Vercel dashboard**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure there are no typos in variable names

2. **Environment variable scope**
   - Make sure variables are set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If your application can't connect to MongoDB:

1. **IP whitelist**
   - Add Vercel's IP ranges to your MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
   - Consider allowing access from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) for testing

2. **Connection string**
   - Verify your MongoDB connection string is correct
   - Ensure username, password, and database name are properly URL-encoded

### Build Time Errors

If your build exceeds Vercel's limits:

1. **Optimize build process**
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies
   - Use `.vercelignore` to exclude files not needed for build

2. **Increase build resources**
   - Consider upgrading to a paid Vercel plan for more build resources

## Post-Deployment Verification

After successful deployment, verify:

1. **Functionality**
   - Test all critical user flows
   - Verify authentication works
   - Test API endpoints

2. **Performance**
   - Check page load times
   - Verify image optimization is working
   - Test responsiveness on different devices

3. **Error logging**
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
   - Check server logs for any issues

## Continuous Deployment

To ensure smooth future deployments:

1. **Set up preview deployments**
   - Configure Vercel to create preview deployments for pull requests

2. **Implement pre-commit hooks**
   - Use husky to run linters and tests before commits

3. **Add deployment checks**
   - Set up status checks to prevent merging code that fails to build
